    title: "Do you why Jain flag has five colors ?",
    description: "The five colors of the Jain flag represent panch parmesthi and different concepts in Jainism. Here is what each color represents, White color represents the arihants, souls who have conquered all passions (anger, attachments, aversion) and have attained omniscience and eternal bliss through self-realization. It also symbolizes Ahimsa or non-violence, which is one of the fundamental principles of Jainism. It reminds Jains to avoid violence in thought, speech, and action.Red color represents the siddha it also represents Satya or truthfulness. Jainism emphasizes the importance of speaking the truth and being honest in all aspects of life.Yellow color represents the acharya , it signifies non-stealing , Green color represents the upadhyaya (adepts), those who teach scriptures to monks. It also signifies celibacy, Black or dark blue color represents the sadhus and sadhvis or monks and nuns. It also signifies non-possession(aparigraha). Overall, the five colors on the Jain flag remind Jains of the important values and principles of Jainism, and encourage them to live a life of compassion, non-violence, truthfulness, self-restraint, humility, and purity.",

The curved line above the three dots is called Siddha Shila, which is a place in the highest realms of the Universe where enlightened souls such as Arihants and Siddhas reside eternally with supreme bliss.",
